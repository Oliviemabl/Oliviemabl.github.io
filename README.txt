EPUB Files Notice
=================

The EPUB files (tidying.epub and crimson.epub) need to be actual EPUB format files.

EPUB is a ZIP-based format that requires:
- mimetype file
- META-INF/container.xml
- OEBPS/ folder with content.opf, toc.ncx, and XHTML files

To test EPUB functionality:
1. Download free EPUB samples from sources like:
   - Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org)
   - Standard Ebooks (standardebooks.org)
   - Feedbooks (feedbooks.com/publicdomain)

2. Rename them to:
   - tidying.epub
   - crimson.epub

3. Place them in this books/ folder

The PDF files (astro.pdf and zerofail.pdf) are minimal test PDFs that will display basic text when loaded.
